This Gen AI Analytics Tool is a natural language-powered business intelligence dashboard that enables non-technical users to query complex datasets using plain English. It eliminates the need for SQL or data expertise by allowing users to:

â€¢Ask business questions in natural language (e.g., "Show me sales trends by region last quarter")
â€¢ Get instant AI-generated insights with visualizations (charts, tables, summaries)
â€¢ Reduce dependency on data teams by automating data analysis
â€¢ Make faster decisions with real-time, accurate analytics

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (NLP) Search â€“ Understands business questions in plain English
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Visualization â€“ Auto-generates charts (bar, line, pie) based on query
ðŸ”¹ Query History â€“ Saves past searches for quick re-runs
ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Suggestions â€“ Recommends follow-up questions
ðŸ”¹ Mock Data Simulation â€“ Simulates real-world business data responses

ðŸš€ Technical Approach
1. Frontend Architecture (React + Redux)
React.js (Vite) â€“ Fast, modern SPA with reusable components

Redux Toolkit â€“ Centralized state management for queries, results, and history

Chart.js / Recharts â€“ Interactive data visualizations

Tailwind CSS â€“ Responsive, clean UI design

2. AI & Data Flow (Simulated for Prototype)
Since this is a frontend prototype, we simulate AI processing with:

Mock Data Generation â€“ Dynamically creates realistic datasets based on query keywords

Query-Specific Responses â€“ Different results for sales, customers, inventory, etc.

Loading States â€“ Simulates API delay (1.5s) for realistic
